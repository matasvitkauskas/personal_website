      <description>Co-authored a review paper titled â€œTotal Recall: Lateral habenula and psychedelics in the study of depression and comorbid brain disordersâ€œ. It can be accessed through this link: https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/18/6525 Received training in handling zebrafish and various genetic manipulation techniques. (examples include extracting DNA from zebrafish, PCR, bacterial transformation, injection of a DNA vector to zebrafish embryos.) Optimized light/dark the acquisition in a behavioral assay for measuring scotophobia in larval zebrafish. Wrote python scripts to analyze the locomotion of larval zebrafish.</description>

      <description>Worked in Dr. William Renthal&amp;rsquo;s lab with single-cell ATAC-seq data on a project about cell-specific epigenetic regulation in the Dorsal Root Ganglion. Link to the lab website: https://renthal.bwh.harvard.edu/ Integrated single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq datasets. Performed differential open-chromatin analysis and transcriptional motif enrichment using the Signac package. Created a shinyapp that visualizes open-chromatin areas from the dataset along with gene expression data for each cell type (Deployment on the web is still in progress).</description>

      <description>Bachelor-thesis titled â€œCosmetic neurology at scale: developing a high-throughput phenotypic screening for novel nootropics in D. melanogasterâ€ supervised by Dr. Jan Gruber. Optimized drug delivery (CAFÃ‰ feeding assay) and 3 different behavioral tests for automation purposes. Independently performed statistical analysis (power calculations, t-test, ANOVA) and visualizations of experimental data using R. Created hypoxia recovery assay to model recovery from anesthesia in fruit flies. Discovered that lacing fly food with caffeine, nicotine, modafinil, and l-theanine all improve the rate of recovery from CO2 anesthesia in relation to sucrose-fed flies.</description>

      <description>I am a Lithuanian neuroscientist working in Singapore. I came to Singapore in 2018, when I decided that I want to continue my education 9000 km away from Lithuania at Yale-NUS college. Yale-NUS College is a liberal arts college in Singapore. Established in 2011 as a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore, it was the first liberal arts college in Singapore and one of the first few in Asia.</description>

      <description>I am currently working as a 80% dry-lab, 20% wet-lab research assistant in the single-cell spatial neuromics lab led by Dr. Jinyue Liu. The lab uses single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) in tandem with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) in studying human psychiatric diseases like Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease and autism. The lab employs a human disease model called cerebral brain organoids which are stem-cell-derived &amp;ldquo;mini-brains&amp;rdquo; that are similar to 10-week-old human fetus brains.</description>

      <description>Academic Buddy LT is a Lithuanian non-profit organization that connects Lithuanian undergraduates studying in top US universities with the most prospective Lithuanian high-schoolers. Having benefited from this mentorship network myself, I seek to give back by mentoring students myself. I have been mentoring students since 2019.
My mentorship usually entails helping the students craft narratives in their application essays, tips on how to most cost-effective ways to prepare for admissions tests (SAT, ACT), and performing mock interviews.</description>

      <description>The Integrative Neuroscience Association (INA) is a Lithuanian NGO that gathers young Lithuanian neuroscientists to promote the broad development and application of neuroscience for diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive purposes. INA works in three main areas: (1) Education and Outreach, (2) Encouraging Science and Innovation, (3) Advocacy and Equity. My main focus at INA is on the â€œEducation and Outreachâ€ area. Here is a list of educational activities that I have been a part of:</description>
